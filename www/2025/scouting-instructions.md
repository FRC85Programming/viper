## Scouting Instructions

Watch your robot and record its actions by clicking on the corresponding up arrows or boxes. You can use the down arrows or undo button if you make a mistake. At the end of the match, there will be some follow-up questions about your robot's ability to manipulate game pieces and whether anything out of the ordinary happened that could skew your data. If you have any questions, please refer them to the desinated Bin Master.

If this is your first match of your scouting wave, don't forget to change your name from the previous scouter's to your own!

### Match Structure
Scouting each match is divided into four periods:
 - **Pre-match** — Before the match has started.
 - **Autonomous** — The robot acts independently without input from human players.
 - **Teleoperated** — The robot is controlled via remote control.
 - **End game** — The robot attempts climb on cages or park under the barge.

Be sure to switch to teleop when auto ends. Forgetting to move to teleop is a common scouting error. The button to proceed to teleop will start flashing <span style=color:red>red</span> and <span style=color:blue>blue</span> to remind you.

### Saving Your Data

Use one of the buttons at the bottom of end game to save the data when you're done with a match. The suggested button will be enlarged — usually this will be the button to progress to the next match, but in certain cases the app will recommend that you upload your data to the scouting hub via ______.
