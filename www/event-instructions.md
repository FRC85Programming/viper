### Scouting

In this section, you can select which type of scouting data you would like to collect about each team and match.

Once a scouting page is open, the tablet, phone, or laptop can disconnected from the internet completely.

You must be logged in as "scouter" or "admin" to be able to upload scouting data.

##### Quantitative Scouting

Collect number/quantitave data about each team as they compete. There will be 6 of these scouters at a time.

##### Pit Scouting

Interview each team about their drivetrain size, weight, autos, and game specific features. There will be designated pit scouters who will do this; they are also required to quantative scout.

##### Qualitative Scouting

Collect notes/qualitative data about each team as they compete. This is super important for match strategy and our pick lists and helps back up a team's quantitative numbers.

##### Top Scouters

You can see who has scouted the most matches here. If you are connected to the internet and blue alliance is synced, you can see which scouters have the most accurate data. There may be prizes for students based on this collection.

### Strategy

In this section, you can visualize data and create match strategies.

The students who will be in on pick list discussions should be the only scouters viewing this data.

##### View Stats

Aid in alliance selection with graphs of each teams performance. This also can be used for creating our pick list and comparing teams.

Open this page, unplug from the scouting briefcase, and take your device down to the field.

##### Driver Sheet with Whiteboard

Use scouting data to inform match strategy. You can plan out matches using the whiteboard, quantitative data, qualitative data, and pit scouting data.

Open this page, unplug from the scouting briefcase, and take your device down to the field.

### Data
